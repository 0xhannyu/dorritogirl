		<p><br><br>Before that, have you ever tried the street food from there? I'm not like those who frequents those stalls<br>
		very often so I won't say it is the best fried roll in the city. But the sauce was so... somewhat had a hint of tangy sourness<br>
		yet had a balance with the spiciness. And the fried skin of roll was crunchy and steam hot, and when dipped with the sauce, it<br>
		tasted so good, that I start to salivate when I think about it. Even now my mouth is watering. Let's try that together someday?</p>
